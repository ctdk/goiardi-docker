goiardi-docker
--------------

A repository of Dockerfiles and such for running goiardi and associated services inside docker.

Still in progress as far as getting everything together goes.

Usage
=====

Layout
======

* `goiardi/` - The various goiardi Dockerfiles are in here. The `latest` one, oddly enough, has whatever's in the latest master branch. Dockerfiles for specific releases are in subdirectories here as well, at least when they get made.

* `docker-compose/` - docker-compose configs for different goiardi configurations.
